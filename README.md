*Example of mod operation - creating an image from falling blocks*

## üìã Description

This mod allows you to create beautiful artistic compositions from falling blocks in Minecraft. The mod analyzes images and creates three-dimensional structures using various height generation algorithms, turning ordinary images into structures made of sand blocks. When the first block is destroyed, the entire structure begins to fall, creating an amazing animation that gradually reveals the hidden image. Each block falls in the correct sequence, forming the original picture during the falling process.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple height generation algorithms**: several different algorithms for creating unique structures
- **Asynchronous generation**: Does not block the server during creation of large images
- **Gradual block placement**: Blocks are placed gradually for better performance
- **Support for various formats**: PNG and JPG images
- **Color palette**: 16 concrete powder colors for accurate image reproduction
- **Interactive commands**: Simple command system with autocompletion
